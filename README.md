# DESCtorch
Deep Embedded Single-cell RNA-seq Clustering implementation with pytorch,  you can find implementation of tensorflow version of DESC in https://github.com/eleozzr/desc.  We will try more complicated network structure and loss function base on DESCtorch in the future!!! I try my best to reproduce result of this paper in https://github.com/yuxiaokang-source/DESC_reproduce.

## Installtion

```
conda create -n DESCtorch python=3.6.10
conda activate DESCtorch
pip install DESCtorch
```

run paul15_tutorial.ipynb for more detail
